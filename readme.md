## Installation

To add the toolbox to a project, you add the package to the project.json :

``` json
    "dependencies": {
        "Digipolis.ServiceAgents":  "4.0.4"
    }
```

ALWAYS check the latest version [here](https://github.com/digipolisantwerp/serviceagents_aspnetcore/blob/master/src/Digipolis.ServiceAgents/project.json) before adding the above line !

In Visual Studio you can also use the NuGet Package Manager to do this.

## Usage

To add a single service agent in your project simply use the **AddSingleServiceAgent&lt;T>** extension in the **ConfigureServices** method in the **Startup** class.
The type represents the implementation of your service agent.
It will be registered as a scoped instance. If the service agent implements an interface of the same name preceded with the letter ‘I’, the interface will be registered as scoped.

``` csharp
    services.AddSingleServiceAgent<YourServiceAgent>(settings =>
    {
        settings.Scheme = "http";
        settings.Host = "test.com";
        settings.Path = "api";
        settings.Headers = new Dictionary<string, string>()
        {
            { "apikey", "apikeyvalue" },
            { "X-Custom-Header", "customheadervalue" },
        };
    });
```
The parameter of type **Action&lt;ServiceSettings>** allows you to set the settings for the service agent.

If you want to configure the agent using a configuration file or if you want to register multiple service agents use the **AddServiceAgents** extension instead.

``` csharp
    services.AddServiceAgents(settings =>
    {
        settings.FileName = Path.Combine(ConfigPath, "serviceagents.json");
    });
```

If your agents are located in a different assembly then the executing assembly, you can pass that assembly as a parameter, this is optional.

``` csharp
    services.AddServiceAgents(settings =>
    {
        settings.FileName = Path.Combine(ConfigPath, "serviceagents.json");
    },
	assembly: AssemblyWithAgents);
```

The json file contains one or multiple sections, one per service agent.

The structure of the json file is:

``` javascript
{
    "Global": {
    },
    "TestAgent": {
      "AuthScheme": "None",
      "Host": "test.be",
      "Path": "api",
      "Port": "5001",
      "Scheme": "http",
      "Headers": {
          "apikey": "123456789",
          "X-Custom-Header": "customheadervalue"
      }
    }
}
```

A first object (section) section named **Global** can optionally be defined.
THis section is intended for settings that are common to all the service agents.

Each other object (section) in the json represents a service agent type. **The object name has to match the service agent type name**.
See the [Creating a service agent](#creating-a-service-agent) section for more info on creating the service agents.

If you have a generic service agent, the section name must match the class name of the agent, without the generic part. For example, for a generic agent of type **GenericAgent&lt;T&gt;** the section name must be **GenericAgent**.

Following options can be set per section (service agent):

Option              | Description                                                | Default | Mandatory
------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------
AuthScheme              | The authentication scheme to be used by the service agent. | "None" |
Host | The host part of the url for the service agent. | "" | X
Path | The path part of the url for the service agent. | "api" |
Port | The port for the service agent. | 443 fo https, 80 for http |
Scheme | The scheme of the url for the service agent. | "https" |
Headers | A key-value collection representing the headers to be added to the requests. | null |
BasicAuthUserName | The user name used for basic authentication scheme. | "" | With BasicAuth scheme
BasicAuthPassword | The password used for basic authentication scheme. | "" | With BasicAuth scheme
OAuthPathAddition | Oauth path addition for OAuth authentication scheme. | "" | With Oauth scheme
OAuthClientId | Oauth client id for OAuth authentication scheme. | "" | With Oauth scheme
OAuthClientSecret | Oauth client secret for OAuth authentication scheme. | "" | With Oauth scheme
OAuthScope | Oauth scopt for OAuth authentication scheme. | "" | With Oauth scheme

All the url parts form the basic url for the service agent: {scheme}://{host}:{port}/{path}/

An overload for both **AddSingleServiceAgent&lt;T>** and **AddServiceAgents** is available where you can pass an action of type **Action&lt;IServiceProvider, HttpClient>** that gets invoked when the underlying HttpClient gets created. That way you can customize the created client.

Important notice: the action gets invoked for every service agent when multiple are registered!
``` csharp
    services.AddServiceAgents(s =>
    {
        s.FileName = Path.Combine(ConfigPath, "serviceagents.json");
        s.Section = "TestAgent";
    },
    (serviceProvider, client) =>
    {
        //customize the client
    });
```

## Creating a service agent

In order to create a service agent you need to create a type that derives from **AgentBase**.

``` csharp
    public class DemoAgent : AgentBase
    {
        public DemoAgent(IServiceProvider serviceProvider, IOptions<ServiceAgentSettings> options)
            : base(serviceProvider, options)
        {
        }
    }
```

The **AgentBase** class contains several protected methods to perform the basic http actions (get, post, put and delete). All the methods are async.

Some examples:

Implement a get operation

``` csharp
    public class DemoAgent : AgentBase
    {
        public DemoAgent(IServiceProvider serviceProvider, IOptions<ServiceAgentSettings> options)
            : base(serviceProvider, options)
        {
        }

        //A basic get operation
        public Task<Address> GetAddressAsync(int id)
        {
            return base.GetAsync<Address>($"adress?id={id}");
        }

        //A basic post operation
        public Task<Address> PostAddressAsync(Address adress)
        {
            return base.PostAsync<Address>("adress", adress);
        }
    }
```

If you want to return the response as string you can use the **GetStringAsync** method on the **Agentbase**.

``` csharp
    public Task<string> GetAddressAsStringAsync(int id)
    {
        return base.GetStringAsync($"adress?id={id}");
    }
```


## Using a service agent

In order to use a service agent simply ask the **serviceProvider** for an instance of the agent's type and use it.

For example in a controller:

``` csharp
    public class ValuesController : Controller
    {
        private DemoAgent _serviceAgent;

        public ValuesController(DemoAgent serviceAgent)
        {
            _serviceAgent = serviceAgent;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<string> Get()
        {
            var result = await _serviceAgent.GetAddressAsync(1);

            //do something...

            return "somestring";
        }
    }
```

If your agent implements an interface with the same name preceded with an **I**, the agent is registered as an implementation of that interface.
In that case you need to request an instance of the interface type:

``` csharp
    //The service agent implementation
    public class DemoAgent : AgentBase, IDemoAgent
    {
        public DemoAgent(IServiceProvider serviceProvider, IOptions<ServiceAgentSettings> options)
            : base(serviceProvider, options)
        {
        }

        //Some implementation
    }

    //The usage
    public class ValuesController : Controller
    {
        private IDemoAgent _serviceAgent;

        public ValuesController(IDemoAgent serviceAgent)
        {
            _serviceAgent = serviceAgent;
        }
    }
```  

## Authentication schemes

Different schemes are available to be used with the service agents.

Possible schemes:

* None
* Bearer
* OAuthClientCredentials
* Basic

**Note!** Since version 4.0.0 of the toolbox the "ApiKey" scheme has been removed. If you need to add api key to the request, use the "Headers" property of the **ServiceSettings**.
This allows you to combine an authentication scheme with an api key header.

Check the [Creating a service agent](#creating-a-service-agent) section to see how to define the scheme for your service agents.

### None

No authentication is done.

### Bearer

With the Bearer scheme the authentication is done through use of the authorization header:

    Authorization Bearer xxx
where xxx is the token.
To use the Bearer scheme set the **AuthScheme** property of the **ServiceSettings** object to the value "Bearer".
The token is extracted from the **UserToken** property of the **AuthContext** object provided by the dependency injection infrastructure.


### OAuthClientCredentials

This will use the OAuth2 client credentials flow to obtain a (bearer)token from a token endpoint.

To use the OAuth Clientcredentials scheme set the **AuthScheme** property of the **ServiceSettings** object to the value "OAuthClientCredentials".

You must also supply following settings in the ServiceSettings:
``` csharp
  OAuthClientId = "f44d3641-8249-440d-a6e5-61b7b4893184";
  OAuthClientSecret = "2659485f-f0be-4526-bb7a-0541365351f5";
  OAuthScope = "testoauthDigipolis.v2.all";
  OAuthPathAddition = "oauth2/token";
```

See the SampleApi for more info.

### Basic

With the Basic scheme the authentication is done through use of a Basic Authentication header.

    Authorization Basic yyy
where yyy is the base 64 encoded username and password.  

Basic authentication can only be used with an "https" scheme except for the **Development** environment!

To use the Basic scheme set the **AuthScheme** property of the **ServiceSettings** object to the value "Basic".
The **user name** and **password** can be entered in the settings.
``` javascript
{
    "Global": {
    },
    "TestAgent": {
      "AuthScheme": "Basic",
      "Host": "test.be",
      "Path": "api",
      "Port": "5001",
      "Scheme": "https",
      "BasicAuthUserName": "userName",
      "BasicAuthPassword": "password"
    }
}
```

If you don't want to enter your user name and password in the json configuration file you can use an overload of the **AddServiceAgents** method that accepts a parameter of type **Action&lt;ServiceAgentSettings&gt;**
to alter the values of the service settings after they have been loaded from the json file.
``` csharp
    services.AddServiceAgents(json =>
    {
        json.FileName = Path.Combine(ConfigPath, "serviceagents.json");
    }, serviceAgentSettings =>
    {
        var settings = serviceAgentSettings.Services.Single(s => s.Key == nameof(TestAgent)).Value; 
        settings.BasicAuthPassword = "userNamefromcode";
        settings.BasicAuthUserName = "passwordfromcode";
    }, null);
```
